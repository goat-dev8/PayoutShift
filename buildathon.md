Cloakd v2 a new direction - product live at: https://www.cloakd.ai 

For this wave, I decided to take a completely new approach.

In the previous version of Cloakd, my focus was mainly on privacy, allowing users to send or request crypto payments without ever revealing their wallet address. While that worked well for a specific group of users, I started to realize that it was too narrow.

The truth is, people who deeply care about privacy already have multiple tools and solutions available to them. And for most other users, Cloakd v1 might have actually felt a bit too dark and “techy.” The interface had a hacker-style aesthetic — dark colors, cryptic vibes, and an overall focus on hiding things.

That’s when I knew it was time for a change.

For Cloakd v2, I shifted the entire goal of the project. Instead of focusing only on privacy, the new mission is to make crypto payments easier for everyone — especially in a multi-chain world.

Imagine this: a user wants to request payment in coin X on chain Y, but their friend or client only has funds on chain A. This is exactly where the magic of Cloakd and SideShift comes in.

Cloakd v2 turns that complicated situation into something simple, a multi-chain payment request service that just works.

The new design and experience are built around being open, friendly, and trustworthy. I wanted the platform to feel welcoming — something you’d happily use to request payments from friends, family, coworkers, or clients. Whether it’s for freelance work, splitting a bill, or requesting payment for a service — it should feel easy, safe, and fun.

What’s New This Wave:

Besides the fresh approach and friendlier design, I’ve added a lot of new functionality to make the experience smoother and more powerful. Here’s what’s new:

** see the next section, 4th wave, for the answer to what is new this wave **

Looking Ahead

I’m really proud of how this version turned out, and I feel it fits much better with SideShift’s vision. The integration feels natural, and I hope this is something you’re as excited about as I am.

Cloakd v2 represents a big shift, from privacy-only to useful, accessible, and fun. It’s something I can see everyday users benefiting from, and I’m genuinely happy with the new design and direction.

I’m really happy with this new approach and can’t wait to see how it evolves. I hope SideShift enjoys this version as much as I do, and maybe, just maybe, this could be the start of something bigger together.

UI improvements are really nice, I think you could market this really well. One thing I noticed when trying out the demo is, you're currently not doing any wallet address validation. So I accidentally put an EVM wallet for a SOL payment and it was accepted by your server. Good work, look forward to seeing this go to market.

Nice improvements from wave 1, the design is much more normie friendly, which as you say is a much wider user base than privacy focused people. I think the next step is to get users, which is the most difficult.

P.S. I figured out why I said your demo website doesn't work last time, there's a typo in the "Live demo" at the product overview: https://www.claokd.ai/

Congratulations on going live!  Great job and welcome back for Wave 2! Great to see Cloakd evolving and you have clearly worked hard on making improvements from Wave 1 - it looks much nicer. 

Overall: I really like your product and its new design. I also like the fact you are clearly thinking deeply about the user and making this as easy and accessible as possible,  along with your future plans for growth - we will support you in this journey where we can! It's nice to see a submission as well that has been written by a human and not AI generated (from what I can tell!) - well done.

Next steps for wave 3:  Live test user groups and real user data for some real feedback and to understand the traction. Execute on your plan and ask for help and support where you need it. Keep going - this is a good one!

The demo website does not work, but what the video shows looks great. The code on github is not actually for the product, but only a SideShift SDK, which is fine if you're actually going to go live with this app and don't want to open source it. The implement of the SDK is actually solid. The idea itself is great and solves a real problem, excited to see what wave 2 will bring.

Impressive. I like this a lot and feel like you have spent time, care, and attention to detail with this. One of my favourite submissions so far and feel like you're onto a use case here, that will be extremely valuable to many people. Really nice touch on the user experience standpoint, validating the format of the wallet address, depending on the chain - this is great. It would be great if you can launch this as soon as possible to test user groups and start getting some real traction and user feedback in. This is what we would like to see in wave 3! Great job.

OctaneShift
Hidden
OctaneShift
⚡ Instant gas top-ups via Telegram or web — swap any crypto for native gas in seconds
Updates in this Wave
🔥 OctaneShift Pro — Gas Autopilot for Web3
OctaneShift monitors your wallets, predicts when you’ll run low, and refills the right amount of native gas on the right chain in one click. It’s 100% non‑custodial and powered by the SideShift API (no widget). Instead of being “just a wrapper,” OctaneShift orchestrates monitoring, quoting, settlement, and proof end‑to‑end.
What’s new in Wave 2

1. 🚨 Low‑Gas Monitor + 1‑Click Deep Links
• Add wallets per chain (EVM first), set thresholds.
• When below threshold, Telegram/email alert includes a signed deep link that opens a pre‑filled, fixed‑quote top‑up.
• Suggested amounts by chain (e.g., +1 tx, +5 tx, +1 day).

2. 🎯 Ready‑to‑Mint Presets (deeper DeFi angle)
• Presets like “Mint on Base” and “Trade on Arbitrum.”
• We compute a recommended gas pack and create a fixed quote with settle preview and “why this amount” tooltip.

3. 👥 Batch Team Top‑Ups
• Refill multiple wallets across chains in one flow.
• Per‑recipient min/max hints, fixed quotes where possible, clean fallback to variable.
• Single “Pay Now” panel, live status chips, retries/backoff, idempotency.

4. 🎁 Gas Gift/Request Links
• Share a link that encodes chain, target address, and requested amount for sponsors/support.

5. 🔎 Proof + 📈 Status
• Proof page with shift IDs, tx hashes, and per‑recipient receipts.
• Public status (in‑app): uptime, chains supported, and shifts today.

6. 🛡️ Security, Compliance, API Depth
• 100% API flow: /v2/coins (memos), /v2/pairs (min/max), /v2/quotes → /v2/shifts/fixed (preferred) with refundAddress, /v2/shifts/variable fallback, /v2/shifts/{id} tracking.
• /v2/permissions gate with x-user-ip; simulator mode for restricted regions.
• Server‑only secrets, strict CSP, rate‑limits, no userIp on GET, idempotency keys.
• POL naming everywhere (Polygon token rename).

7. 
✨ UX Polish
• Above‑the‑fold Start Swapping + Start Monitoring.
• Fixed/Variable toggle with exact settle preview.
• Quick‑amount chips, recommended deposit asset badge, min/max hints, copy‑to‑clipboard, explorer links.

Why this matters
• From “gas wrapper” to proactive infrastructure: automation, orchestration, safety rails, and provable outcomes—fully SideShift‑powered.

I really like the top-up feature. It would be great to include it as part of the swap flow, so users can automatically get native tokens for gas on the destination chain: either for onboarding if they don’t have any yet, or so they can interact with their swapped tokens on that chain with enough gas.

Really like this, super simple idea, I would probably use this. I agree with the other comments, would also add:

Could be cool to have some live gas prices, maybe presets could adjust based on chain gas price * avg gas limit & some multiplier? Also to have some kind of loyalty programme where if I shift a certain amount I can get a free topup? Good work, look forward to seeing where you go with this.

Nice improvements from wave 1, it shows that you've considered our comments. The next step would be to have some people use your product, which is probably the hardest.

Nice improvements from Wave 1 - thank you for submitting for wave 2 and looking forward to what next in wave 3. 

What I liked: You have taken time to make further improvements for the user experience and clearly have future plans and goals reaching into 2026! Next step is to get some users testing this for real - we would love to see that. It will be helpful for you to get some real user feedback. 

What I didn't like: "Wave 2 Features" on the demo app. You are not building this for us / for this buildathon. You are building your product to solve a problem for a real world user. Ignore us and focus on the user! If you want to call out "new features" then include release notes somewhere else on the website, or find another way of showcasing improvements. 

Our recommendation: Aim to launch to a test user group as soon as you can and work on what you can to add credibility to your tool - social profiles of founders etc.

Fair point - Wave 1 is indeed close to a focused SideShift wrapper.

Wave 2 changes that completely:
• AI-powered gas optimization & predictions
• Cross-chain routing intelligence  
• Automated portfolio rebalancing
• Smart wallet integration & monitoring
We're building the infrastructure layer that makes SideShift one component of a larger DeFi automation platform.
The gas use case was just our wedge into the broader vision. Thanks for the push - excited to show you the differentiation in Wave 2.

I like the fact that you're marketing the product as a "gas topup" app, even though SideShift can do way more, you might find better product market fit if you're focusing on this specific use case. It's nice that you a website and a telegram bot too, I would advise to put the shifting functionality at the top of your website though, I had to scroll down to actually use the product, which isn't the best UX. For the code part you don't need to use userIp for getting a shift, only for creating one MATIC token no longer exists, it's called POL now. I would also advise you not to call the SideShift API directly from the website, as it exposes your private key to anyone who can look at the network requests. All in all it's a good start and excited to see what wave 2 will bring.

Thank you so much for the helpful feedback!

What I just shipped
- Added a “Start Swapping” button next to “Launch Bot” that takes users straight to the swap UI (no scrolling).

Security (Network requests)
- I reviewed DevTools → Network and the frontend code.
- The browser only calls our backend (octaneshift-api-1.onrender.com).
- No direct calls to sideshift.ai from the browser, and no x-sideshift-secret headers in any Network requests.
- If you’ve seen otherwise, could you share steps to reproduce and a screenshot (URL + headers)? I’ll fix immediately and rotate the key if needed.

Code reference (frontend calls our API)
src/services/api.ts
const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://octaneshift-api-1.onrender.com';
const api = axios.create({ baseURL: API_BASE });

export const octaneAPI = {
  getQuote: async (from: string, to: string, amount?: string) =>
    (await api.get(`/api/pair?from=${from}&to=${to}${amount ? `&amount=${amount}` : ''}`)).data,
  createShift: async (shiftData: any) =>
    (await api.post('/api/shifts/variable', shiftData)).data,
  getShift: async (shiftId: string) =>
    (await api.get(`/api/shifts/${shiftId}`)).data,
  getPermissions: async () => (await api.get('/api/permissions')).data,
};
```

Clarifications / Next wave
- MATIC → POL: not changed yet (to avoid breakage). We’ll complete the full POL migration in Wave 2 alongside backend updates.
- We’ll also add more chains and ship several UX/feature improvements.

Thanks again—really appreciate the guidance and excited to show Wave 2!

>Added server route /api/shift/create → uses SideShift /v2/shifts/variable.
>All sensitive headers (x-sideshift-secret) are securely handled on the backend.
>Supports affiliate monetization via affiliateId and commissionRate.
>Returns a clean, normalized response (shiftId, depositAddress, etc.).
>Logs key details for debugging while hiding sensitive data.

4. Confirmation & Status Tracking
>Displays shift confirmation with:
>QR code for the deposit address
>Deposit amount and memo/tag (if applicable)
>Live shift status fetched every 5s via /api/shift?id=<shiftId>
>Includes an expandable accordion panel showing:
  From/To token and network
  Network fee (in coin + USD)
  Average processing time
  Expiry countdown (human-friendly format)
  Refund address and shift type
>Provides a Cancel (Back) button for users to abort before sending funds.

5. Shift Cancellation & Cleanup
>Added /api/shift/cancel route → calls SideShift /v2/cancel-order endpoint.
>Used to:
  Cancel unconfirmed or unused shifts.
  Prevent “Too many open orders” errors.
>Automatically triggered:
  When user clicks “Back” in the confirmation step.
 When user closes, refreshes, or navigates away (via beforeunload with keepalive fetch).
  Displays a “Cancelling…” loading state to maintain UX consistency.
  Keeps the SideShift account clean and prevents abandoned shifts.

We transitioned from the SideShift widget to a fully backend-secured, API-driven tipping flow delivering a cleaner, faster, and safer experience for creators and fans while adhering to SideShift’s integration best practices.

In your demo video you created a shift from 10 USDC -> USDT and then display send between 5 - 60000 USDC, I would probably just skip the "how much you want to donate" part and maybe not even display how much the streamer will receive. AFAIK Twitch isn't very transparent about how much they take from each donation either.
Also, cancelling shifts is not necessary if you use the `x-user-ip` header, which you actually should, since you proxy requests through your own backend. The "Too many open orders" error is based on user IP, so your users won't be affected.

 Otherwise I like your product.

Hey Mike, appreciate the detailed feedback!

Actually platforms like kick, twitch, YouTube doesn't play any role in external TTS/donos, they only take a cut when the users use their in built features like superchat, gifting bits, subs, memberships etc.

Also yes we can switch to more minimal UI to display only relevant info to donos, info like detailed conversion summaries etc could be optional.

Yes we saw sending user IP in header when going through docs, but didn't realise the actual advantage of it, thanx for sharing that we will add it in our header!

Much better that you're using the API. I think this could have some real potential if you focus more on making it appealing to the kind of audience that watches streamers. 

Also you're having permission issues with the API because your server is hosted in the US, I would recommend using a different server location for now.

Hey George and team, apologies for the inconvenience, actually during testing locally just before pushing to prod, we realised the cancel mechanism of a shift needs more robustness as our app is not b2b, at least at first stage.

We ran into rate limits pretty quick while testing,  therefore we are integrating a lightweight db layer for better management and tracking orders/shift hence the delay, we will push to prod soon in few hours!

Apologies again!

Hey! Love this idea and the use case! Here's my feedback:
- Would be cool to see a ranking of who donated the most per day/total, would go well with your idea of rewards of top donors
- Highly suggest using API or https://pay.sideshift.ai/ instead of widget

Good potential here, I'd like to see how the UX could compliment the target market better. I'm a viewer watching a stream, could I scan a QR code overlay and begin the flow there? If I'm a streamer, could I choose between superchats and TTS reads to fit my content style? Good start, let's see how you can make use of the sideshift API to improve these flows.

Great MVP. live alerts, TTS, overlays, and multi-chain via SideShift got you to value fast. One note: you’re using the SideShift widget (not the API), which limits branding, data, and fallback logic. For the next wave, consider an API-based flow.

What it does - this is clear from your explanation and demo. Good job! 
The problem it solves - Interesting that you have spotted this as an issue and it makes sense. Potentially a large target market if the problem is a real pain point for streamers on various platforms. 
I like the fact you are thinking ahead and planning to build out further features and further refine the user experience. 
It would also be nice to a slightly more "integrated" use of the sideshift powered swap so that users still feel like they are using the same tool rather than being taken elsewhere. 
The other judges will take a look at the documentation and technical implementation in more detail. Any questions , please reach out and looking forward to seeing where this one goes in the next wave!

The biggest issue I see is that users would have to give up custody of their funds when creating what you call workflows. Will they be willing to do so? I'm not sure and this might be heavily limiting user adaption of your app.

Regardless, I like the idea of automating shifts based on price movement and there's potential in your app I believe.

On the technical side, please pass the end users IP address to the SideShift API via x-user-ip header.

Hi Mike,
Thank you for the thoughtful feedback and for recognizing the potential in automating shifts based on price movements!
On the point about custody. The current implementation does require users to execute the swap manually after conditions are met, which I agree could be a friction point. For the next wave, I'm planning to address this with two approaches:
1. Non-custodial automation: Integrate with smart contract wallets (like Safe) where users pre-approve spending limits. The workflow executor would only trigger transactions within approved parameters - users maintain full custody while enabling automation.

2. Optional custodial mode: For users comfortable with it, offer a managed service where small amounts can be deposited specifically for automated strategies, similar to how trading bots work on exchanges.

Regarding the technical feedback, absolutely right about the x-user-ip header. I'll implement that in the next update to ensure proper compliance with SideShift's API requirements.
Thanks again for the encouragement and the technical guidance. Looking forward to refining this for Wave 3!

Also the demo app - great job. 
This submission demonstrates strong technical execution capability - built complete DeFi automation platform in 7 days solo with real API integrations (SideShift, CoinGecko, Safe SDK) . Shows product-thinking and user experience focus - created 8 pre-built templates, visual workflow builder, and clearly invested time making complex conditional logic accessible. Exhibits problem-solving resilience - overcame multiple technical challenges including API documentation difficulty, TypeScript type conflicts, and real-time data synchronisation. Good job!

Hi George,
Thank you so much for the detailed feedback and the vote for Wave 2! I really appreciate you taking the time to review both the demo video and the app.
I'm glad the technical execution came through. Your recognition of the problem-solving aspects (API documentation challenges, TypeScript conflicts, real-time sync) means a lot, as those were definitely the toughest hurdles.

Your feedback on next steps is spot-on. For Wave 3, my priorities are:
1. Real user traction: Moving beyond technical demo to actual user testing with a beta program
2. Skill gap mitigation: Specifically around backend infrastructure scaling and production-grade security
The goal is to transform this from a proof-of-concept into a platform people actually use daily for their DeFi strategies.
Thanks again for the encouragement and constructive feedback. Excited to show you what's next!

Contract (Base Mainnet): https://basescan.org/address/0xfc0323F3c5eD271564Ca8F3d4C5FfAD32D553893
Contract (Base Sepolia): https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xa3713739c39419aA1c6daf349dB4342Be59b9142

Goal: Move from MVP to an automated, insight-driven polling experience by enabling SideShift-powered reward distribution, adding a dynamic analytics layer for real-time participation and rewards, and improving the funding and claiming user experience.

Mainnet enablement for SideShift flows
• Deployed PollsContract to Base Mainnet to test live SideShift transactions.

Contract upgrades for distribution logic
• Added three distribution modes: MANUAL_PULL, MANUAL_PUSH, AUTOMATED.
• New events: DistributionModeSet, RewardDistributed, RewardClaimed.
• Refactored to fix stack-depth issues;

SideShift integration groundwork
• Created Shifts data model and backend services to record SideShift orders and statuses.
• Implemented User Preferences with preferred-token selector (100+ tokens) and auto-claim toggle.
• Claim flow can initiate SideShift conversion to preferred assets and execute on-chain withdrawals.
• Automation worker (Bull + Redis) spec’d for Wave 3 to enable background auto-claim.

Real-time tracking and data pipeline
• Built Event Listener Service using Viem to capture on-chain events (create, vote, fund, distribute, claim, withdraw) with durable checkpoints.
• Supports historical backfill and near-real-time sync, forming the basis for analytics and leaderboards.

Dynamic analytics (backend)
• Added /analytics endpoints for system overview, poll statistics, trends, reward mode breakdowns, engagement metrics, and poll comparisons.
• Data drawn from the synced event store (PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM) for fast queries.

Frontend improvements to funding and claiming UX
• New Settings page with token selector, auto-claim switch, and clear fee tooltips.
• Improved wallet flows, loading/error/success states, and responsive navigation.
• Hooks and components connected to analytics and preferences APIs, ready for future chart integration.

IDO/Launchpad (v1)
• Initial module to list sales and collect contributions, designed to route post-sale rewards through the SideShift-aware distribution path.

Status vs Goals
• Automated reward distribution: Core contract and SideShift order path complete; background worker planned next.
• Dynamic analytics: Backend ready; frontend dashboard begins next wave.
• Real-time tracking: Event ingestion and DB sync shipped; WebSocket push planned.
• Funding and claiming UI: Shipped (settings, flows, notifications) aligned with SideShift logic.

Deliverables
Contracts, API, and App repositories include API_DOCUMENTATION.md, EVENT_LISTENER.md, PREFERENCES_FEATURE.md, and SIDESHIFTAI.md (frontend and backend integration guides).

Yes, there were a lot of bugs/defects I had to address and this really was my fault. I had to wait for the right timing to get into the zone which meant overlooking certain flows which resulted in certain flows not getting fully tested and demo video not being created.

But what I was able to test so far:
- creation of polls through the Base Sepolia Network and Base Mainnet
- Creating shifts to move one crypto token to another network
- Funding of polls using the shifted crypto

A challenge that I have so far is that I use the token contract address that comes from sideshift for the USDC token which is different when I'm testing in Base Sepolia. So far, I do a workaround by sticking with the native token for testing in Base Sepolia, and use Base Mainnet for testing USDC.

For the next wave, I plan to complete the loop of creating polls, funding polls, and claiming poll rewards.

Since you're proxying requests to the SideShift API through your own backend, you should use pass the actual users IP address as `x-user-ip`. This prevents "Too many open orders" error, which you will currently face if more than 5 orders are created and don't receive deposits. Currently when I try to create a shift I get access denied error, which is probably because you're hosting your backend in a restricted area (USA is my guess), this could be avoided by passing the user IP.

It would've been nice to submit a demo video.

Otherwise still a very interesting use case and something innovative. You only need to fix a few things to actually make it work in wave 3

The execution is really good, the bot feels snappy (which I love). I'm a fan of the price alerts, that's a nice touch! My suggestion for that feature though would be to set price alerts in USD by default. I couldn't actually find USDT/USDC in the menu. The option to set alerts based on different assets is a nice feature, but should be an advanced feature if users want it. Great work!

Good job, I think the next step is testing all cases to make sure it all works, then to try and get users!

Good job implementing (most of) what we've suggested in the feedback. Your product already works, so the next step is to put it in front of users, this is often the most difficult

Wow this is lightning fast. You've demonstrated clear technical capability through functional product - working Telegram bot with NLP integration and SideShift API implementation. As a solo founder you've shown self-sufficiency and ability to ship complete product independently (GitHub repository shows active development). Recommendations for wave 3: Execute on your growth strategy and bring in more real users. gather feedback and data to back up and inform your future plans. We will support where we can - lets goooo!

Solid for a first wave submission! The bot is very responsive. For the next wave I'd consider adding in some additional messaging to tell users which assets are available. Also if a user inputs a coin SideShift doesn't support mention that. Great start!

Interesting idea trying to use natural language to create shifts.

Would be interesting to explore how this could be extended. Use an LLM? An agent? What else could the LLM/agent do that would bring value to the user? 

While natural language is a "natural" interface, it might not always be the best. Consider when it would make sense to use other UI elements.

Thanks for the feedback.
Great points - definitely taking this into consideration. You're right that natural language isn't always the best interface. I'll think about the right balance between NL and structured UI elements, and what real value an LLM/agent could add beyond just parsing commands.

As other have noted a telegram bot is not the most original idea, but yours works well as an MVP, so definitely excited to see what you can do in wave 2. 
What I suggest you to add to the bot is:
- if you're going to stick to fixed rate shifts, show the users how much of the settle coin they will receive
- users do mess up everything. What will happen if they send 0.31 ETH instead of 0.3? You have to at least add a way to contact SideShift support, but even better would be to allow users to set their refund address via the API should their shift need a refund
- I would maybe use variable orders instead of fixed rate if you only want to do "Shift XXX ETH to SOL", if sticking to fixed rate why not allow specifying the settle amount, i.e. "I have ETH and need 0.3 SOL to address XXX"

All in all it's a good MVP for a telegram bot but definitely needs more work before putting it in front of users

Thank you for the detailed technical feedback.
Some of the points you mentioned were already considered to be in the next waves and other points  your comment was really insightful to take in mind and begin adding it to the NeuraXchange plan to be production-ready by the end of the waves.

We have had a few telegram bot submissions and yours does look like a good use of the API, so well done. It is not the most creative or original idea, so what would make this stand out is either very high quality user experience or unique features. What we would love to see is how you can set your product apart from other telegram bots that use the SideShift API , including our own one. We have a telegram trading bot so it would be cool to see you doing something different. The AI integration is impressive and I like the fact that you manually confirm or deny the swap requests. What is planned next for Wave 2 and 3? We are interested to see this one develop, refine, and improve :) Nice work!

Impressive work! You've built a working Telegram bot with real AI integration - the natural language interface is smooth and the SideShift API implementation is solid. Having a live demo judges can actually test is a huge advantage.

Strengths:
  - Novel AI application
  - Working live demo
  - Clean codebase
  - Good track fit

Flaws:  
 - Doesn't show settlement amount (deal-breaker)
  - No address validation
  - Limited to 5 coins and limited network coverage (doesn't showcase SideShift's power) - https://github.com/AhmedAmer72/NeuraXchange/blob/main/src/nlp.ts#L9

The foundation is excellent - with these UX improvements, this could be a top-tier submission. You're close! 🚀

Updates in this Wave
The application might spun down due to inactivity, if that happens you can refer to the video for the demonstration and lemme know on the tg, i'll try to get it back up.

Enhanced UX & Reliability

This wave introduced four major features that dramatically improve the bot's usability, intelligence, and safety.

1. Voice Interface Implementation
Users can now send a voice message instead of typing. The bot transcribes the audio using Groq's Whisper API and processes the resulting text command.

- bot.ts
  - Dependencies: Added axios (for downloading the file), fs (for saving temp files), path (for file paths), and execSync (for running ffmpeg).
  - FFmpeg Check: On startup, the bot now checks if ffmpeg is installed on the server. If not, it logs a warning, as voice messages will fail.
  - New Handler: Added bot.on(message('voice'), ...) to catch all voice messages.
  - Logic:
    1. The handler gets the file_id from ctx.message.voice.file_id.
    2. It calls ctx.telegram.getFileLink(file_id) to get a private download URL for the .oga file.
    3. axios downloads the audio file as a buffer.
    4. fs.writeFileSync saves the buffer to a temporary file (e.g., temp_12345.oga).
    5. execSync calls ffmpeg -i temp_12345.oga temp_12345.mp3 -y to convert the file to MP3, which the transcription API requires.
    6. The new transcribeAudio function is called with the MP3 file path.
    7. The bot replies with I heard: "..." and passes the transcribed text to the handleTextMessage function, unifying the command logic for both text and voice.
    8. Finally, fs.unlinkSync cleans up both the .oga and .mp3 temp files.

- groq-client.ts
  - New Function: Added an async exported function transcribeAudio(mp3FilePath).
  - Logic: This function uses groq.audio.transcriptions.create() with the "whisper-large-v3" model to get the transcription from the provided MP3 file.

2. Transaction Tracking & Status Updates
Users can now check the status of their swaps at any time using the /status command.

- sideshift-client.ts
  - New Function: Added getOrderStatus(orderId).
  - Logic: This performs an authenticated GET request to the https://sideshift.ai/api/v2/shifts/:orderId endpoint.
  - New Type: Added the SideShiftOrderStatus interface to strongly type the JSON response from the API.

- database.ts
  - Schema Change: Modified the CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders statement.
    - Added a tx_hash TEXT column to store the user's outbound transaction hash.
    - The status column was changed to a generic TEXT to accommodate various statuses from the API (e.g., waiting, confirming, settled).
  - New Functions:
    - getLatestUserOrder(telegramId): Fetches the most recent order for a user, used by /status if no ID is provided.
    - updateOrderStatus(sideshiftOrderId, newStatus): Updates the status field for an order in our local DB.
    - setOrderTxHash(sideshiftOrderId, txHash): Populates the new tx_hash column after a user sends their transaction.

I'm having a hard time connecting my MetaMask wallet, but it's good to see that the /checkout APIs are being used correctly in your TG bot. Looking forward to seeing what will be improved in the next wave.

This looks like a solid functional Telegram bot! My suggestion for wave 3 is to work out some clear USPs and add in those features. You mentioned DeFi composability before, that could add some interesting value!

Solid improvements from wave 1. Thank you for submitting again and continuing to improve your product. The inclusion of the sideshift pay / checkout api is a cool addition - nice one!
What we want to see next is this product scaling. A co-founder to help you, launching the bot in live, start testing with real users and getting feedback in to help improve the product offering. Do you still intend to have the website as well as I think just the telegram bot may turn some users away who prefer to use the website or mobile site app. solid effort and keep going. Lets get this launched!

I would very much like to see the voice message feature in action. There are quite a few telegram bots submitted here and SideShift also has it's own, but the voice feature would really make it stand out.

Great to see this as a telegram bot now, fits the use case much better. 

Some things to iron out for the next iteration. The aim of this project seems to be making crypto transfers less complex and more natural. But the session management and wallet connect seem to be making this more complex. Are there any other options? 

Also the pitch was "Your Voice-Activated Crypto Trading Assistant." would be great to have seen a demo of that feature.)
